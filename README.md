## Project Overview

In this project, you will use logistic regression, deep neural networks, and convolutional neural networks to create a digit recognition deep learning system. First, you will implement the digit recognition system using a simple logistic regression multiclass classifier. Afterwards, the model will be upgraded using a deep neural network. Finally, the digits will be recognized using a CNN and performance will be compared among the various implementations. The dataset used will be the MNIST dataset, and the deep learning framework to implement the algorithms will be TensorFlow.
